# Release Notes

## Latest changes
- Added fullscreen close/search controls for the PDF Viewer (widget and Academy), raised overlay z-index, and improved contrast.
- Ensured the Academy header includes a Dashboard button when embedded in the main app.
- Hid the Calculator bar when any widget is expanded/fullscreen.
- Reduced video action buttons (Learn More / Reel View) opacity to ~20% with no blur for less visual intrusion.
- Kept smaller, hover-only left/right page controls, positioned separately within the PDF viewer.
- Added drag-and-drop PDF upload handling (accepts PDF by type/extension) in the viewer and wired it through the widget/Academy flows.
- Kept search accessible in fullscreen via the search button; search sidebar available even in fullscreen.
